# Twitch List

This application is for [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front-End Certification projects. You can view the freeCodeCamp project details [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api).

I decided to re-visit older Front End projects and give them a facelift and recreate them from scratch now that I've made more progress on my coding journey. This repository contains the progress of the new and improved Twitch Streaming application. 

You can view the old solution I made using jQuery on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Nestik/full/MowvKa/), you'll notice the older version lacks personality!

#### freeCodeCamp User Stories
- [ ] - I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- [ ] - I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- [ ] - if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

### Additional Personal Goals
- [ ] - Responsive Design
- [ ] - User Authentication
- [ ] - Back-End that handles User Input via a MongoDB
- [ ] - As an authenticated User, I can add and remove Streamers from my list of "watched" streamers.

I understand this is a Front-End application project but I wanted to stretch it so a user could add streamers they liked without having to worry about having someone elses streamers added or their own removed from a global list. I also understand this application probably won't be visited or used enough to warrant this functionality but I wanted to go the distance regardless and treat it as if it was going to be a production client requested application.
